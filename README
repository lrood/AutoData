I wrote this program using Python 3.4  This program should be used with an ELM327 interface that communicates at 38400 baud.
This program will display some sensor data from most cars 1996 to present.  The program needs tkinter and pyserial.  Most of the work
was in the translation of the data from hexidecimal to a readable format.  The data is taken from the buffer and converted to 
decimal form and then it must be run through a formula to make the data useful.

The data will then be displayed.  The data will be further formatted when it is displayed.
The windows version uses an automatic port detection.
